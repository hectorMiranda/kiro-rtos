# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves designing a PCB board that integrates an Arduino Nano with essential components for a gaming/interactive device. The PCB will serve as a foundation for users to build their own hardware by downloading the design files and ordering from PCB manufacturers. The board must accommodate an OLED display, multiple input buttons, audio feedback, and provide access to remaining GPIO pins for extensibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a maker, I want a downloadable PCB design that integrates an Arduino Nano with essential components, so that I can order and assemble my own gaming device hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the PCB design files THEN the system SHALL provide Gerber files compatible with major PCB manufacturers
2. WHEN a user reviews the design THEN the system SHALL include schematic files in standard formats (KiCad, Eagle, or PDF)
3. WHEN a user examines the board layout THEN the system SHALL show proper component placement and routing for all specified components
4. WHEN a user checks manufacturing requirements THEN the system SHALL include a bill of materials (BOM) with part numbers and specifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PCB to accommodate an Arduino Nano and SSD1306 OLED display, so that I can run firmware and provide visual feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Arduino Nano is mounted THEN the PCB SHALL provide secure mechanical connection through pin headers or sockets
2. WHEN the SSD1306 display is connected THEN the PCB SHALL route I2C signals (SDA, SCL) with proper pull-up resistors
3. WHEN power is applied THEN the PCB SHALL provide 3.3V and 5V power rails to appropriate components
4. WHEN the display is mounted THEN the PCB SHALL provide mechanical mounting points or header connections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want 6 push buttons for game input, so that I can interact with games and applications running on the device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buttons are pressed THEN the PCB SHALL provide debounced digital input signals to the Arduino
2. WHEN examining the layout THEN the PCB SHALL position buttons for ergonomic access during gameplay
3. WHEN buttons are connected THEN the PCB SHALL include pull-up resistors or utilize internal pull-ups appropriately
4. WHEN multiple buttons are pressed THEN the PCB SHALL handle simultaneous button presses without interference
5. WHEN buttons are mounted THEN the PCB SHALL provide clear labeling or silkscreen markings for identification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a buzzer for audio feedback, so that I can provide sound effects and notifications in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the buzzer is activated THEN the PCB SHALL provide appropriate driving circuitry for the buzzer
2. WHEN audio is generated THEN the PCB SHALL connect the buzzer to a PWM-capable Arduino pin
3. WHEN the buzzer operates THEN the PCB SHALL include current limiting or protection as needed
4. WHEN examining the layout THEN the PCB SHALL position the buzzer to avoid interference with other components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want access to remaining Arduino pins through a breakout port, so that I can extend the functionality with additional sensors or components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the breakout port THEN the PCB SHALL expose all unused Arduino Nano pins
2. WHEN connecting external components THEN the PCB SHALL provide clearly labeled pin assignments
3. WHEN using the breakout THEN the PCB SHALL maintain signal integrity for digital and analog pins
4. WHEN accessing pins THEN the PCB SHALL use standard connector types (headers, JST, or similar)
5. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the PCB SHALL include pinout diagrams for the breakout port

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a manufacturer, I want the PCB design to follow standard manufacturing constraints, so that I can produce the boards reliably and cost-effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the design THEN the PCB SHALL use standard PCB thickness (1.6mm typical)
2. WHEN examining traces THEN the PCB SHALL maintain minimum trace width and spacing per manufacturing capabilities
3. WHEN checking vias THEN the PCB SHALL use standard via sizes and drill specifications
4. WHEN reviewing layers THEN the PCB SHALL use a 4-layer stackup (Top Layer, Int1 GND, Int2 PWR, Bottom Layer) for improved signal integrity and power distribution
5. WHEN examining the board size THEN the PCB SHALL optimize dimensions for cost-effective manufacturing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive documentation and assembly instructions, so that I can successfully build and troubleshoot my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide assembly instructions with component placement diagrams
2. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL include testing procedures and common issue resolution
3. WHEN ordering components THEN the system SHALL provide a complete BOM with supplier information
4. WHEN reviewing the design THEN the system SHALL include electrical specifications and operating parameters
5. WHEN examining connections THEN the system SHALL provide clear wiring diagrams for external connections
