# MinuxStation - Devpost Submission

## Project Name
**MinuxStation: Educational RTOS Gaming Platform**

## Elevator Pitch
An educational platform combining custom RTOS development, hardware design, and game programming to create a tiny handheld gaming console powered by Arduino Nano. Students learn embedded systems, real-time programming, and hardware design while building and programming their own retro-style gaming device.

## Inspiration
The project was inspired by the need for hands-on embedded systems education that combines hardware, firmware, and software development. Classic gaming consoles like Game Boy provided the perfect context for learning real-time operating systems, memory optimization, and hardware constraints in an engaging way.

## What it does
MinuxStation is a comprehensive educational platform featuring:

- **Custom RTOS**: A preemptive multitasking kernel optimized for Arduino Nano's 2KB RAM and 32KB flash
- **Gaming Hardware**: PCB design with OLED display, 6 buttons, potentiometer, buzzer, and GPIO expansion
- **Game Development SDK**: C++ framework for creating memory-efficient games
- **Web Platform**: React + Three.js site for downloading games, PCB files, and 3D-printable enclosures
- **Windows Client**: C++ application for flashing games and managing the device
- **Educational Content**: Comprehensive tutorials covering embedded systems concepts

## Challenges we ran into

### Memory Constraints
Arduino Nano's 2KB RAM required extreme optimization:
- Implemented custom memory allocator
- Used bit-packed graphics for efficient sprite storage
- Optimized task switching to minimize stack usage
- Created compression algorithms for game assets

### Real-Time Performance
Maintaining 60 FPS with limited processing power:
- Optimized display driver with DMA-like transfers
- Implemented frame-rate independent game logic
- Used fixed-point arithmetic instead of floating-point
- Profiled and optimized critical code paths

### Hardware Integration
Balancing functionality with size constraints:
- Careful component selection for power efficiency
- PCB routing optimization for minimal interference
- Button placement for comfortable gameplay
- Thermal management for sustained operation
